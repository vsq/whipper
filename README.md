Whipper is a Python 2.7 CD-DA ripper, fork of the morituri project (_CDDA ripper for *nix systems aiming for accuracy over speed_). It improves [morituri](https://github.com/thomasvs/morituri) which development seems to have halted merging old ignored pull requests, improving it with bugfixes and new features.

Whipper is developed and tested _only_ on Linux distributions but _may_ work fine on other *nix OSes too.

In order to track whipper's current development it's advised to check its commit history (README **isn't** still complete).

## Installation

Whipper still isn't widely available as an official package in many Linux distributions so, in order to use it, it may be necessary to build it from its source code. If you are building from a source tarball or checkout, you can choose to use whipper installed or uninstalled _but first install all the required dependencies_.

This is a noncomprehensive summary which shows whipper's packaging status (unofficial repositories are probably not included):

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/whipper.svg)](https://repology.org/metapackage/whipper)

User mruszczyk is also providing an unofficial [Copr repository](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/mruszczyk/whipper/) for Fedora / CentOS.

In case you decide to install whipper using an unofficial repository just keep in mind it is your responsibility to verify that the provided content is safe to use.

### Required dependencies

Whipper relies on the following packages in order to run correctly and provide all the supported features:

- [cd-paranoia](https://www.gnu.org/software/libcdio/), for the actual ripping
- [cdrdao](http://cdrdao.sourceforge.net/), for session, TOC, pre-gap, and ISRC extraction
- [python-gobject-2](https://packages.debian.org/en/jessie/python-gobject-2), required by `task.py`
- [python-musicbrainzngs](https://github.com/alastair/python-musicbrainzngs), for metadata lookup
- [python-mutagen](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mutagen), for tagging support
- [python-setuptools](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools), for installation, plugins support
- [python-requests](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/requests), for retrieving AccurateRip database entries
- [pycdio](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pycdio/) (to avoid bugs please use `pycdio` **0.20** & `libcdio` >= **0.90** or, with previous `libcdio` versions, `pycdio` **0.17**), for drive identification (required for drive offset and caching behavior to be stored in the configuration file)
- [libsndfile](http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/), for reading wav files
- [flac](https://xiph.org/flac/), for reading flac files
- [sox](http://sox.sourceforge.net/), for track peak detection

### Fetching the source code

Change to a directory where you want to put whipper source code (for example, `$HOME/dev/ext` or `$HOME/prefix/src`)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JoeLametta/whipper.git
cd whipper
```

### Building the bundled dependencies

Whipper uses and packages a slightly different version of the `accuraterip-checksum` tool:

You can edit the install path in `config.mk`

```bash
cd src
make
sudo make install
cd ..
```

### Finalizing the installation

Install whipper: `python2 setup.py install`

## Usage

Whipper currently only has a command-line interface called `whipper` which is self-documenting: `whipper -h` gives you the basic instructions.

Whipper implements a tree of commands: for example, the top-level `whipper` command has a number of sub-commands.

Positioning of arguments is important:

`whipper cd -d (device) rip`

is correct, while

`whipper cd rip -d (device)`

is not, because the `-d` argument applies to the `cd` command.

~~Check the man page (`whipper(1)`) for more information.~~ (currently not available as whipper's documentation is planned to be reworked ([Issue #73](https://github.com/JoeLametta/whipper/issues/73))).

## Getting started

The simplest way to get started making accurate rips is:

1. Pick a relatively popular CD that has a good chance of being in the AccurateRip database
2. Analyze the drive's caching behavior

   `whipper drive analyze`

3. Find the drive's offset.

   Consult the [AccurateRip's CD Drive Offset database](http://www.accuraterip.com/driveoffsets.htm) for your drive. Drive information can be retrieved with `whipper drive list`.

   `whipper offset find -o insert-numeric-value-here`

   If you omit the `-o` argument, whipper will try a long, popularity-sorted list of drive offsets.

   If you can not confirm your drive offset value but wish to set a default regardless, set `read_offset = insert-numeric-value-here` in `whipper.conf`.

   Offsets confirmed with `whipper offset find` are automatically written to the configuration file.

   If specifying the offset manually, please note that: if positive it must be written as a number without sign (ex: `+102` -> `102`), if negative it must include the sign too (ex: `-102` -> `-102`).

4. Rip the disc by running

   `whipper cd rip`

## Configuration file documentation

The configuration file is stored according to the [XDG Base Directory Specification](
http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html)
when possible.

It lives in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/whipper/whipper.conf` (or `$HOME/.config/whipper/whipper.conf`).

The configuration file follows python's [ConfigParser](https://docs.python.org/2/library/configparser.html) syntax.

The possible sections are:

- Main section: `[main]`
  - `path_filter_fat`: whether to filter path components for FAT file systems
  - `path_filter_special`: whether to filter path components for special characters
  
- MusicBrainz section: `[musicbrainz]`
  - `server`: the MusicBrainz server to connect to, in `host:[port]` format. Defaults to `musicbrainz.org`.

- Drive section: `[drive:IDENTIFIER]`, one for each configured drive. All these values are probed by whipper and should not be edited by hand.
  - `defeats_cache`: whether this drive can defeat the audio cache
  - `read_offset`: the read offset of the drive

- Rip command section: `[rip.COMMAND.SUBCOMMAND]`. Can be used to change the command options default values.
  **Please note that this feature is currently broken (being this way since [PR #122](https://github.com/JoeLametta/whipper/pull/92) / whipper [v0.4.1](https://github.com/JoeLametta/whipper/releases/tag/v0.4.1)).**

Example section to configure `whipper cd rip` defaults:

```Python
[rip.cd.rip]
unknown = True
output_directory = ~/My Music
track_template = new/%%A/%%y - %%d/%%t - %%n
disc_template = %(track_template)s
profile = flac
```

Note: to get a literal `%` character it must be doubled.

## Backward incompatible changes

- Rely on `cd-paranoia` (`libcdio-cdparanoia`) instead of `cdparanoia` (Xiph): changed dependency ([PR #213](https://github.com/JoeLametta/whipper/pull/213) / whipper [v0.6.0](https://github.com/JoeLametta/whipper/releases/tag/v0.6.0))
- Introduced AccurateRip v2 support: added new `requests` python dependency ([PR #187](https://github.com/JoeLametta/whipper/pull/187) / whipper [v0.6.0](https://github.com/JoeLametta/whipper/releases/tag/v0.6.0))
- Added CD-R media type disc detection: CD-R rips are now prevented by default ([PR #154](https://github.com/JoeLametta/whipper/pull/154) / whipper [v0.6.0](https://github.com/JoeLametta/whipper/releases/tag/v0.6.0))
- Changed all `morituri` references to `whipper`: renamed python module and logger too ([PR #109](https://github.com/JoeLametta/whipper/pull/109) / whipper [v0.6.0](https://github.com/JoeLametta/whipper/releases/tag/v0.6.0))
- Profiles (for encoding) aren't supported anymore since ([PR #121](https://github.com/JoeLametta/whipper/pull/121) / whipper [v0.5.0](https://github.com/JoeLametta/whipper/releases/tag/v0.5.0)): now whipper encodes to FLAC
- The image retag feature has been knowingly broken since ([PR #130](https://github.com/JoeLametta/whipper/pull/130))
- Structural changes broke compatibility with existing logger plugins ([PR #94](https://github.com/JoeLametta/whipper/pull/94))
- Dropped external git submodules ([PR #31](https://github.com/JoeLametta/whipper/pull/31), [PR #92](https://github.com/JoeLametta/whipper/pull/92))
- Whipper executable name changed: from `rip` to `whipper` ([PR #70](https://github.com/JoeLametta/whipper/pull/70))
- Whipper has adopted new config/cache/state file paths ([PR #42](https://github.com/JoeLametta/whipper/pull/42))
  - Now always follows XDG specifications

    - Paths used when XDG environment variables are available:
      - `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/whipper`
      - `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/whipper`
      - `$XDG_DATA_HOME/whipper`

    - Paths used when XDG environment variables are **NOT** available:
      - `$HOME/.config/whipper`
      - `$HOME/.cache/whipper`
      - `$HOME/.local/share/whipper`

  - Configuration file information:
    - `.moriturirc`, `morituri.conf` aren't used anymore

    - When XDG environment variables are available it's located in:
      - `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/whipper/whipper.conf`

    - When XDG environment variables are **NOT** available it's located in:
      - `$HOME/.config/whipper/whipper.conf`

  - Plugins folder path:
    - When XDG environment variables are available it's located in:
      - `$XDG_DATA_HOME/whipper/plugins`

    - When XDG environment variables are **NOT** available it's located in:
      - `$HOME/.local/share/whipper/plugins`

## Running uninstalled

To make it easier for developers, you can run whipper straight from the
source checkout:

```bash
python2 -m whipper -h
```

## Logger plugins

Whipper supports using external logger plugins to write rip `.log` files.

List available plugins with `whipper cd rip -h`. Specify a logger to rip with by passing `-L loggername`:

```bash
whipper cd rip -L what
```

### Official loggers

- [morituri-yamlloger](https://github.com/JoeLametta/morituri-yamllogger) - default whipper logger (provided as external logger for compatibility with morituri), yaml format
- [morituri-eaclogger](https://github.com/JoeLametta/morituri-eaclogger) - eac-like logger attempting to maintain strict compatiility with EAC
- [morituri-whatlogger](https://github.com/RecursiveForest/morituri-whatlogger) - eac-like logger containing the informational enhancements of the yamllogger, originally designed for use on What.CD

## Contributing

### Bug reports & feature requests

Please use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/JoeLametta/whipper/issues) to report any bugs or to file feature requests.

When filing bug reports, please run the failing command with the environment variable `WHIPPER_DEBUG` set. For example:

```bash
WHIPPER_DEBUG=DEBUG WHIPPER_LOGFILE=whipper.log whipper offset find
gzip whipper.log
```

And attach the gzipped log file to your bug report.

Without `WHIPPER_LOGFILE` set, logging messages will go to stderr. `WHIPPER_DEBUG` accepts a string of the [default python logging levels](https://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.html#logging-levels).

### Developing

Pull requests are welcome.

**WARNING:** As whipper is still under heavy development sometimes I will force push (`--force-with-lease`) to the non master branches.
